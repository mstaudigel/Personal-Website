<div id="aboutMe" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>My name is Matthew Staudigel and I am a senior at the University of Cincinnati. Although with little to no 
        experience with software development, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering because I have always been 
        fascinated with computers, whether it be hardware or software. Throughout my time at UC, I completed courses such as Digital Design, 
        Calculus I-III, Linear Algebra, Data Structures, Network Analysis, Electronics I, and many more. </p>

    <h1>GOALS</h1>
    <p>I intend to pursue a career in software development, whether it involves testing, debugging, or development itself. 
        I desire a future that allows me to not only utilize my skills in programming, but sharpening them as well. 
        I would also consider a future working on the hardware side, involving work with embedded systems or computer architecture.</p>

    <h1>CO-OP EXPERIENCE</h1>
    <p>Upon finishing my third year at the University of Cincinnati, I have completed three co-op terms. My first two terms were spent 
        working as an IT Co-Op at thyssenkrupp Bilstein of America, a shock absorber manufacturer for some of the world's well-known car makers. 
        At Bilstein, I resolved hundreds of technical issues employees faced, ranging across the IT spectrum from creating domain user accounts to printer issues. 
        I also designed the architecture of the new print server that was on track to replace a decrepit print server. Over my year spent at the company, 
        I imaged over 200+ desktops and laptops for new employees and for hardware redistribution within the company. Although working in IT was not what I 
        expected I would be doing for my first two co-op terms, I gathered experience with customer service and dealing with highly stressful situations. 
        Learning to interact with other employees on a professional level is a strong trait that I will utilize for the rest of my professional career.

            â€‹
            
        For my third co-op term, I worked as a Software Engineering Co-Op at Siemens PLM Software. At Siemens, contributed to the Product Engineering Software 
        (PES) organization, working with the company's CAD software, NX. There, I was placed in the NX Drafting team, which works with the software's 2D drawing application. 
        My responsibilities as a co-op consisted of developing internal debugging tools for the Drafting team's developers, as well as developers of PES.
        Working at Siemens allowed me to apply my knowledge in C++, developing new dialogs (GUIs) with the language. I was also exposed to Python as well, 
        creating test cases for resolved problem reports submitted by NX customers or internal employees. I plan to return to the company for my fourth co-op term in August 2017.</p>

    <h1>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h1>
    <p>Over the years I spent in high school and in college for my undergraduate studies, I have tried to complete my own side projects and 
        become more involved in my community. I have volunteered for the Joe Nuxhall Miracle League Fields, where I contributed landscaping and 
        volunteering help to Kim Nuxhall's unbelievable organization and fields. I volunteered with Habitat for Humanity to help build houses from 
        the ground up for needy families. I have helped out with Krohn Conservatory, which provides fantastic butterfly shows for the community, and 
        I have contributed help to Miami University, particularly with the concessions during the heavily crowded and popular hockey games.
    
        Outside of class, I have created a few side projects during my free time. When I find myself out of school, I try to go through 
        free online training for a new programming language or how to efficiently use git. I love to spin up virtual machines of 
        different types of operating systems to see how differently they work from the standard and popular Windows. For example, 
        I have recently discovered Kali Linux and would like to investigate more about its system penetrating capabilities. 
        Completing recent co-ops have finally allowed me to build my first PC, which has been a goal of mine since the end of high school. 
    
        I have also utilized more of the Android OS capabilities by downloading the Android App Tasker, which is an 
        application where the user can harness the basic tasks of an Android, such as sending texts, making calls, 
        settings, etc. and automating them however he/she pleases. I like to make automated scripts using Tasker to 
        automate the simplest things that we take for granted. For example, a script that I run on my phone will 
        detect Bluetooth connectivity in my car and will deactivate any mobile data sending or receiving from/to my phone. 
        In other words, the task helps deter me from texting and driving. Another example script that I wrote is 
        an automatic text message sender. If I receive a phone call from a highly important person such as a loved 
        one and miss that call, the script will send out a message to that person letting them know that I will 
        reach out to them as soon as I can. As of right now, I am working on a Tasker script that will synchronize 
        with my Google Calendar, which contains the birthdays of all my family and friends, and will send a text 
        message saying "Happy Birthday!".</p>
