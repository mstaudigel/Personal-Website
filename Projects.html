<h1>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h1>
<p>Over the years I spent in high school and in college for my undergraduate studies, I have tried to complete my own side projects and 
    become more involved in my community. I have volunteered for the Joe Nuxhall Miracle League Fields, where I contributed landscaping and 
    volunteering help to Kim Nuxhall's unbelievable organization and fields. I volunteered with Habitat for Humanity to help build houses from 
    the ground up for needy families. I have helped out with Krohn Conservatory, which provides fantastic butterfly shows for the community, and 
    I have contributed help to Miami University, particularly with the concessions during the heavily crowded and popular hockey games.

    Outside of class, I have created a few side projects during my free time. When I find myself out of school, I try to go through 
    free online training for a new programming language or how to efficiently use git. I love to spin up virtual machines of 
    different types of operating systems to see how differently they work from the standard and popular Windows. For example, 
    I have recently discovered Kali Linux and would like to investigate more about its system penetrating capabilities. 
    Completing recent co-ops have finally allowed me to build my first PC, which has been a goal of mine since the end of high school. 

    I have also utilized more of the Android OS capabilities by downloading the Android App Tasker, which is an 
    application where the user can harness the basic tasks of an Android, such as sending texts, making calls, 
    settings, etc. and automating them however he/she pleases. I like to make automated scripts using Tasker to 
    automate the simplest things that we take for granted. For example, a script that I run on my phone will 
    detect Bluetooth connectivity in my car and will deactivate any mobile data sending or receiving from/to my phone. 
    In other words, the task helps deter me from texting and driving. Another example script that I wrote is 
    an automatic text message sender. If I receive a phone call from a highly important person such as a loved 
    one and miss that call, the script will send out a message to that person letting them know that I will 
    reach out to them as soon as I can. As of right now, I am working on a Tasker script that will synchronize 
    with my Google Calendar, which contains the birthdays of all my family and friends, and will send a text 
    message saying "Happy Birthday!".</p>
